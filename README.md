# TCP Testsuite for FreeBSD based on Packetdrill

This TCP testsuite focuses on testing FreeBSD's TCP stack.

It it based on the packetdrill testtool.  The original version is available from
[Google's repsoitory](https://github.com/google/packetdrill). However, this version
does not really run on FreeBSD. The extended version available from
[NPLab's respository](https://github.com/nplab/packetdrill) which overcomes this
limitation and also adds support for SCTP and UDPLite.
